Hello world
This will be uploaded to GitHub
So I was able to push this file to git successfully after series of trials
I switched from HTTPS to SSH protocol
Created a host key on SSH protocol through a youtube video I watched
i still experienced some issues with pushing repository,
Just as a way of troubleshooting, I deleted the previously created remote repository
I created a new remote repo and I created a new file and I was able to push it successfully,
It seemed the new remote repo I created was registered with the new SSH key and it was in sync with git
